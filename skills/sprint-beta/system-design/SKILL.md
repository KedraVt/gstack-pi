name: system-design
description: Provides a standard protocol for building a *system-design_XX.md* file. Describes tactical Domain-Driven Design, maps engineering transaction sequences, and outlines dynamic, stack-agnostic architectures. Use when translating a user story into the technical architecture of a sprint.

# Workflow
* **domain & behavior**:
  * **Scan User Story**: Understand what the Product Manager wants through events/brainstorming.
  * **Establish Ubiquitous Language**: Analyze *user-story_XX.md* and extract a strict, shared glossary of technical terms.
  * **Domain & subdomain**: Categorize feature's operational space, distinguish Core domain (based on system invariants) and subdomain (based on supporting/upgrading features). 
  * **Model the Domain**: Define coherent aggregate boundaries and system invariants. Implement a rigorous command/event logic.
* **architecture & infrastructure**:
  * **Context Mapping**: Establish context mapping: you must map the integration boundary of every component affected by the sprint (upstream/downstream relationships, conformist patterns, or anti-corruption layers).
  * **Integration Strategy Justification**: For every Downstream relationship, you must choose and justify a tactical pattern: either an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) to sandbox untrusted data/AI-generated inputs, or a Conformist pattern for direct, internal trust boundaries.
  * **Local Topology Enforcement**: The architectural layout must strictly align with the local container environment (e.g., *compose.local.yaml*). You must specify exact local port mappings dynamically based on the chosen stack (e.g., API on Port X, DB on Port Y) and necessary local host directory volume mounts.
  * **Long-Running Processes**: Define explicit state management (e.g., Saga pattern) for asynchronous jobs to track intermediate states and establish strict unhappy paths.
  * **Immutable API & Stream Contracts**: For every component interaction, you must explicitly draft the exact JSON structures and the precise real-time event types (SSE) to act as an unchangeable contract between frontend and backend teams.
  * **Autonomous Design Mandate**: generate robust JSON contracts following the template, strictly typed, REST-compliant, and directly reflect the Aggregates and Invariants defined in your Domain Modeling. Never use lazy or generic data structures.
  * **Deterministic Infrastructure Planning**: You are explicitly responsible for designing the local network topology. When autonomously assigning local host ports, you MUST follow a deterministic spacing logic to prevent collisions (e.g., APIs on 80XX, Databases on 54XX). When selecting the underlying tech stack for the workers, default to standardized, container-friendly solutions unless specific constraints are present.

# Rules
* **Invariant Accountability&consistency**: Every system invariant identified must be written as a strict Boolean logical condition (e.g., "A ProcessingJob cannot be COMPLETED if OutputPath is NULL"), and must be immutable to guide automated QA verification.
* **Subdomain Isolation**: Explicitly flag whether the components belong to the Core Domain (primary business logic/execution engine) or Supporting domains (API metadata, logging) to prioritize optimization and sandbox security.
* **Context**: Every time you use this skill, ensure that the generated *system-design_XX.md* file strictly corresponds to its specific *user-story_XX.md* counterpart in the root directory.
* **Zero Conversational Filler**: The output must contain ONLY the requested Markdown structure. No conversational filler, introductory remarks, or concluding summaries are allowed.
* **Scalability Enforcement**: The architecture MUST mandate stateless design for all execution workers to support horizontal scaling. Resource quotas and load distribution strategies must be defined.
* **Reliability & Resilience**: Explicitly map failure modes for external dependencies and LLM generation (e.g., handling syntactically broken code). You must define retry policies, dead-letter queues, and circuit breaker implementations.
* **Maintainability & Dependency Direction**: Enforce strict module boundaries. Dependencies MUST flow strictly inwards toward the Core Domain (Ports and Adapters / Hexagonal Architecture principles).
* **Observability Strategy**: Define the distributed tracing protocol across all boundaries (e.g., Client -> API Gateway -> Message Broker/Worker -> Container Logs). Require a unified structured logging format and define key performance metrics to monitor.
* **Strict API Payloads**: You MUST NOT provide vague descriptions for API endpoints. Every network interaction must include the exact JSON request/response payload with keys and data types.
* **SSE Protocol Specification**: When an asynchronous process requires real-time UI updates, you MUST define the exact Server-Sent Events (SSE) contract, outlining the precise event names (e.g., `event: progress`, `event: success`) and the payload structure of the data line.
* **Error Payload Standardization**: Every API contract MUST explicitly outline the JSON structure for Unhappy Paths (4XX/5XX responses). 
* **Runtime Schema Validation**: The architecture MUST mandate the use of runtime schema validators (e.g., Pydantic for Backend, Zod/TypeScript for Frontend) to enforce the immutability of the defined contracts during data exchange.
* **Security & CORS Enforcement**: Every API contract MUST define required HTTP Headers (e.g., Authorization). Furthermore, the architecture must explicitly define Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies between the local Client and API boundaries to prevent browser-level network blocks.

## Architectural Topology & Context Mapping

### Component Topology Boundaries
* **[Client/Frontend Layer]**: Sub-system boundary managing local state and client UI rendering.
* **[API/Orchestration Layer]**: Stateless backend orchestration layer (Upstream to Client / Downstream to Workers or DB).
* **[Execution/Worker Layer]**: Asynchronous execution engine for long-running or resource-intensive tasks.

| Upstream (U) | Downstream (D) | Strategy (ACL / Conformist) | Tactical Purpose & Data Contract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Component A] | [Component B] | [Strategy] | [Explain payload structure (e.g., JSON schema) and how data is digested or isolated by the downstream component] |

### Immutable API Endpoints Contract
