Code implementing the approved plan, a list of justified deviations (if any), and the tests you ran.

## STOP CONDITION
Stop when: the plan is implemented and tests are green.

## CONTEXT
Goal: {goal} | Branch: {branch}
The full plan is in the file: {plan_file}. Read it FIRST and follow it — it contains the goal, scope, architecture, files to change, edge cases, and test strategy agreed with the user.
Context from prior phases:
{plan_summary}

Write production-quality code. Run tests after implementation. Report what was implemented, any deviations from the plan (and why), and any issues.`,

For each goal-related flow: pass/fail verdict + screenshot evidence + severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) per bug found, ending with the line \`COVERAGE: <tested flows>\`.

## STOP CONDITION
Stop when: the required flows are covered OR two passes produce no new findings. Deliverable flows are ALWAYS mandatory.

## CONTEXT
Goal: {goal} | Branch: {branch}

Use the gstack browser tools to test user flows. Core set: gstack_goto, gstack_snapshot, gstack_click, gstack_fill or gstack_type (form inputs — never declare a form flow tested without exercising its inputs), gstack_wait (settle SPAs before asserting), gstack_console with --errors after each flow (silent JS failures are bugs), gstack_screenshot for evidence; others (gstack_network, gstack_select, gstack_scroll, ...) as needed. Report all bugs found with severity.`,

Findings with severity + file:line + concrete failure scenario, a scope check, and a final verdict APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES.

## STOP CONDITION
Stop when: the full diff has been analyzed.

Goal: {goal} | Branch: {branch}

Run git diff to see changes. Check for: bugs, security issues, performance problems, style violations, missing tests. Report findings categorized by severity.`,

Minimal fixes applied for the findings below, tests green, regression coverage for CRITICAL/HIGH findings.

## STOP CONDITION
Stop when: all findings are addressed.

## CONTEXT
Goal: {goal} | Branch: {branch}
Prior findings:
{findings_summary}

Apply minimal, targeted fixes. Run tests after each fix. Report what was fixed.
If your report ends with a \`CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE:\` line, you MUST include that exact line verbatim in your gstack_advance summary.`,

Test commands identified + pass/fail counts + failure details.

## CONTEXT
Goal: {goal} | Branch: {branch}

Use browser tools to test adjacent functionality — same core set as the qa phase (gstack_goto, gstack_snapshot, gstack_click, gstack_fill/gstack_type, gstack_wait, gstack_console --errors). Verify the fix didn't break other flows.`,

1. Analyze the branch diff against the base branch (git diff/log) and classify changes (new features / changed behavior / removed functionality)

## CONTEXT
Sprint {sprint} | Goal: {goal} | Branch: {branch}
This phase runs ONLY after explicit user approval.
